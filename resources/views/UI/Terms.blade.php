When application for cover is submitted the insurer dealing with your request for Insuring may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the terms and conditions of your policy, you must tell the insurer about any incident (such as an accident or theft) regardless of blame and whether a claim has been made or not. When you tell the insurer about an incident, the insurer will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant agents/bodies.</p><br>

This can sometimes take up to 7 days to get your policy details updated on the MID. You can also check information about your own vehicle at www.askmid.com. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing. Police may also use MID data for the purposes of investigating whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor Insuring policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad) other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car Insuring policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this at <a href="http://www.miic.org.uk/">www.miic.org.uk</a></p>
